        "Body": "The same as #26914, but for 5.0.\r\n\r\nThis stops WebSockets from throwing as soon as Kestrel shutdown starts instead of after the ShutdownTimeout. This copies logic we already have in other places like [Http1ContentLengthMessageBody](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/fe6a3fc747096308ac3acdf7d72437f6955490d5/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ContentLengthMessageBody.cs#L98).\r\n\r\nKestrel will call Transport.Input.CancelPendingRead() during shutdown so idle connections can wake up and shutdown gracefully. We manually call CancelPendingRead() to simulate this and ensure the Stream returned by UpgradeAsync doesn\u0027t throw in this case.\r\n\r\nAddresses #26482 for 5.0\r\n",
